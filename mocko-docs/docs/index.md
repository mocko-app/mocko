## Features

- Choose how to manage your mocks
    - Use a simple web UI for speed
    - Use HCL files for documentation and versioning
- Proxy your real API: Requests will be passed through to it unless there's a mock
- Create dynamic mocks using Handlebars (more [here](https://mocko.dev/docs/templating/))
- Easy to deploy: You can deploy it in containers or even using a CLI <!-- TODO reference for deploy doc -->
- Really, **really** fast. Run your tests as fast as you can.

## Use cases
- Mocking integrations for tests, non-productive environments or local development
- Mocking your own services on development environment to make it easy to simulate
complicated scenarios
- Mocking your future services on development environment to allow the front end and
the back end to develop in parallel (after that, delete the mock and it'll be automatically
proxied to the real service)
